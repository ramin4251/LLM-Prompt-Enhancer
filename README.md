# Prompt Enhancer Chrome Extension

## Overview

The **Prompt Enhancer** is a Chrome extension designed to improve the quality of text prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Groq AI API.  It adds an "Enhance Prompt" button next to text areas on web pages. When clicked, the extension sends the text from the textarea to the Groq API, which uses a prompt engineering expert model to refine and enhance the text. The enhanced prompt is then automatically inserted back into the textarea, ready for use in your favorite chat-based LLM platforms.

## Features

* **API Key Storage:** Securely stores your Groq API key locally within the browser for persistent use.

* **Real-time Feedback:** Provides "Enhancing..." status while processing and displays alerts for API key issues or errors.

## Updated popup look
