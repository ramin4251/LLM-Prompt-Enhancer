# Prompt Enhancer Chrome Extension

## Overview

The **Prompt Enhancer** is a Chrome extension designed to improve the quality of text prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Groq AI API.  It adds an "Enhance Prompt" button next to text areas on web pages. When clicked, the extension sends the text from the textarea to the Groq API, which uses a prompt engineering expert model to refine and enhance the text. The enhanced prompt is then automatically inserted back into the textarea, ready for use in your favorite chat-based LLM platforms.

## Features

* **Prompt Enhancement:**  Utilizes the powerful Groq AI API to restructure and refine user-provided text into more effective prompts for LLMs.
* **Seamless Integration:** Adds an "Enhance Prompt" button next to all textarea elements on any webpage, providing easy access to prompt enhancement wherever you need it.
* **API Key Storage:** Securely stores your Groq API key locally within the browser for persistent use.
* **User-Friendly:** Simple popup interface to set and save your Groq API key.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Provides "Enhancing..." status while processing and displays alerts for API key issues or errors.

## Updated popup look

* The popup presents a compact Groq API Key screen with a title, a single key field, and clear primary actions for saving the key.
* The popup loads any previously saved key on open and provides a brief saved status message after storing changes.

* **API Usage:** Using this extension will consume your Groq API credits based on the number of tokens processed during prompt enhancement. Please refer to Groq's pricing for details.
* **Error Handling:** If the API key is not set or if there are issues communicating with the Groq API, the extension will display an alert message.
